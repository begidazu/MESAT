AQs answered: 13, all relevant to benthic habitats (AQ1-13)Changes (ver. June 2024):
Calculations previously were made for entire area of the BBT rather than sea polygons – that was corrected. For the shp file, the view displayed is the SEA area (land polygons removed, separate file with land polygons can be provided if needed)
Final number of ‘SEA’ cells (includes areas marked in EMODNET as N/A): 368,632
Populated cells / ‘SEA’ cells (data coverage %): (349,712/368,632)*100 = 94.9%

LRF originally calculated with a threshold of 5% for all cells – corrected to all populated (assessed) cells 



Changes (ver. January 2025):
Corrected EV calculations (instead of means, max values used in the final assessment of each cell); confidence assessment – no change
