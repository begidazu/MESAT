-------Changes (ver. September 2024):
Land polygons removed from the shp file (input file with polygons did not have them contrarily to the previous version)

Changes (ver. December 2024):
Corrected EV calculations (instead of means, max values was used in the final assessment of each cell); confidence assessment using quantiles

-------

All cells (final number of sea-covering cells in the BBT, includes cells with no data): 2,344
Populated cells / all cells (data coverage %): (130/2,344)*100 = 5.5%

-------
Confidence assessment:
Calculated in R 
*based on the min. (8)- max. (296) recordings per cell 
*130 cells with data assessed
