title: "EVA Overscale"

The Ecological Value Assessment (EVA) is an adaptation, developed by [Franco *et al.*, 2026](add book chapter link), of the Biological Valuation methodology proposed by 
[Derous *et al.*, 2007a](https://pureportal.inbo.be/en/publications/a-concept-for-biological-valuation-in-the-marine-environment/) 
and [Derous *et al.*, 2007b](https://bibliotekanauki.pl/articles/48603). EVA can be defined as the process of assigning a value to an area based on the 
integration of the inherent value of its ecosystem qualities. This value is estimated as the combination 
of a set of metrics (calculated using defined algorithms to answer multiple assessment questions) measuring 
multiple qualities of biodiversity for multiple ecosystem components. Like Biological Valuation, EVA facilitates 
the spatial evaluation of ecosystem properties and allows for the comparative analysis of ecological value (EV) 
among subzones within the study area and can be applied from intertidal to deep-sea areas.

EVA Overscale tab gives you the option to apply partially the EVA methodology wherever you want in the world based on 
the work of [Ocean Biodiversity Information System, 2024](https://shiny.obis.org/distmaps/)
