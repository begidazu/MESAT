title: "EVA Overscale"
---

The Ecological Value Assessment (EVA) is an adaptation, developed by [Franco *et al.* (2026)](add book chapter link), of the Biological Valuation methodology proposed by 
[Derous *et al.* (2007a)](https://pureportal.inbo.be/en/publications/a-concept-for-biological-valuation-in-the-marine-environment/) 
and [Derous *et al.* (2007b)](https://bibliotekanauki.pl/articles/48603). EVA can be defined as the process of assigning a value to an area based on the 
integration of the inherent value of its ecosystem qualities. This value is estimated as the combination 
of a set of metrics (calculated using defined algorithms to answer multiple assessment questions) measuring 
multiple qualities of biodiversity for multiple ecosystem components. Like Biological Valuation, EVA facilitates 
the spatial evaluation of ecosystem properties and allows for the comparative analysis of ecological value (EV) 
among subzones within the study area and can be applied from intertidal to deep-sea areas.

EVA Overscale tab gives you the option to apply partially the EVA methodology worldwide, whilst the species are also present in Europe, based on the work of [Ocean Biodiversity Information System (2024)](https://shiny.obis.org/distmaps/) & 
[OBIS (2025)](https://obis.org).  

## Applied methodology

Due to the data limitations to compute all assessment questions (AQs) worldwide, in particular those AQs related to abundance metrics, we applied the overscaling options using the AQs that could be assessed using Species Distribution Models. 
In the following table the AQs applied in the overcaling option are defined:

| Assessment question                                                                                       |
| ------------------  | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| AQ1                 | Is the subzone characterized by the presence of many Locally Rare Features?         |          
| AQ5                 | Is the subzone characterized by the presence of many Nationally Rare Features?      |           
| AQ7                 | Is the Feature Number in the subzone high?                                          | 
| AQ10                | Is the presence of Ecologically Significant Features high in the subzone?           |          
| AQ12                | Is the presence of Habitat Forming Species/Biogenic Habitats high in the subzone?   |
| AQ14                | Is the presence of Mutualistic or Symbiotic species high in the subzone?            |

We computed the AQs based on the SDMs developed by [Ocean Biodiversity Information System (2024)](https://shiny.obis.org/distmaps) available at [https://mpaeu-dist.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html#](https://mpaeu-dist.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html#). 
The overscaling methodology follows the subsequent steps:

1. Creates the assessment grid from the user study area and grid configuration.
2. Computes the Ecological Value score (very low: 0–1; low: 1–2; medium: 2–3; high: 3–4; very high: 4–5) for each AQ and Ecosystem Component:
    1. **AQ1**
        1. Parses the Locally Rare Feature TaxonIDs configured by the user.
        2. Gets the predicted suitability maps for each TaxonID from the [Amazon S3 bucket](https://mpaeu-dist.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html#).
        3. Converts the suitability maps into binary presence/absence using percentile 10 as threshold.
        4. Selects the Locally Rare Features based on the user-defined threshold.
        5. Computes the score using those TaxonIDs identified as Locally Rare Features.
    2. **AQ5**
        1. Parses the Nationally Rare Features configured by the user.
        2. Gets the predicted suitability maps for each TaxonID from the [Amazon S3 bucket](https://mpaeu-dist.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html#).
        3. Converts the suitability maps into binary presence/absence using percentile 10 as threshold.
        4. Selects the Nationally Rare Features based on the EEZ and grid configuration (if presence < threshold → Nationally Rare).
        5. Computes the score using those TaxonIDs identified as Nationally Rare Features.
    3. **AQ7**
        1. Parses the Locally Rare Feature TaxonIDs configured by the user.
        2. Gets the predicted suitability maps for each TaxonID from the [Amazon S3 bucket](https://mpaeu-dist.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html#).
        3. Converts the suitability maps into binary presence/absence using percentile 10 as threshold.
        4. Computes the score using all TaxonIDs passed in the other AQs.
    4. **AQ10**
        1. Same as AQ7 but using only Ecologically Significant Features.
    5. **AQ12**
        1. Same as AQ7 but using only Habitat Forming Species / Biogenic Habitats.
    6. **AQ14**
        1. Same as AQ7 but using only Mutualistic or Symbiotic species.
