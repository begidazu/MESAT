# Introduction to the application

The Ph.D. TITLE web application aims to be a Proof of Concept of a potential future tool that assesses marine
economic activities affection to habitats and ecosystem service delivery. This information is crucial for informed
decission-making and can promote better-designed Marine Spatial Plans (MSPs) that minimize activity impact and 
maximize ecosystem service delivery, including future climate change effects into habitat distributions and ecosystem
service provision.

Ph.D. TITLE web application is divided into five main sections: (1) management scenarios; (2) saltmarsh evolution; 
(3) physical accounts; (4) EVA overscale; and (5) fish stocks. In all cases, model codes used to obtain the results of
Ph.D Title are available in [./app/models](https://github.com/begidazu/PhD_Web_App/tree/main/app/models) and will be further explained in the corresponging sections.

## About this Documentation

Transparency and reproducibility are an integral part of the research. Thus, here you will find all the details 
of the approaches and decisions taken in this work. This is a complement to the available scientific articles, [thesis](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.178164) 
and codes. Public data sources and/or data obtained in the thesis are available at [fake data]() and results could be found in [`results`](https://github.com/begidazu/PhD_Web_App/tree/main/results).
In case some desired results are not available, please contact: <benat.egidazu@bc3research.org>. However, data sources 
also include other author contributions, in that case you may need to contact those authors for specific datasets.
