This information is crucial for informed decission-making and can promote better-designed Marine Spatial Plans (MSPs) that minimize activity impact and maximize ecosystem service delivery, including future climate change effects into habitat distributions and ecosystem service provision.\nPh.D. TITLE web application is divided into five main sections: (1) management scenarios; (2) saltmarsh evolution; (3) physical accounts; (4) EVA overscale; and (5) fish stocks. In all cases, model codes used to obtain the results of Ph.D Title are available in the folder app/models and will be further explained in the corresponding sections.",

In this sense, you can select Santander Coast, North Sea, Irish Sea, Urdaibai Estuary and Cadiz Bay study areas. The affection in this Proof of Concept is based on the Physical Accounts studies and the Saltmarsh Evolution studies. Thus, it is worth noting that in some study areas you could explore the potential affection on EUNIS habitats and/or saltmarsh and mudflat habitats, under a set of climate change scenarios. The following table is a summary of the available affection in each study area:\nIn order to guide you where the Physical Accounts and Saltmarsh Studies have been conducted in the study areas, here is a map with the location of Physical Account and Saltmarsh Evolution locations in each study area.",

    "text": "2.2 How to interpret affection results?\nThe affection results are presented in table format. Each economic activity affection is further divided into three affection subdivisions – EUNIS, saltmarshes and fish – that represent the affection of the economic activities to the respective subdivision based on the results presented by Egidazu-de la Parte et al. (2026) (EUNIS habitats), Egidazu-de la Parte et al. (2025) and poner link fish study. You can filter the results using SQL queries.\nBelow is a breakdown of what each of the subdivisions represents:\n\nEUNIS: each economic activity + EUNIS tab include the extension (Extent (km^2) field) of each EUNIS habitat type affected by the activity and the condition metric of the portion of the EUNIS habitat area affected by the activity. Condition metric is an indicator of the underlaying status of the habitat and scores from 0 (very low condition) to 5 (very high condition). For more detailed information see Physical Accounts section and Egidazu-de la Parte et al. (2026).\nSaltmarshes: economic activity + Saltmarshes tab include the extension (Extent (ha) field) of saltmarsh, mudflat, upland areas and channel affected by the corresponding activity, as well as the expected accretion (main driver of carbon sequestration in intertidal ecosystems) in those areas that the activities will have impact. For more detailed information see Saltmarsh Evolution section and Egidazu-de la Parte et al. (2025).\nFish: ADD FISH DOCUMENTATION WHEN WE HAVE THE MODELS AND RESULTS",
