This information is crucial for informed decission-making and can promote better-designed Marine Spatial Plans (MSPs) that minimize activity impact and maximize ecosystem service delivery, including future climate change effects into habitat distributions and ecosystem service provision.\nPh.D. TITLE web application is divided into five main sections: (1) management scenarios; (2) saltmarsh evolution; (3) physical accounts; (4) EVA overscale; and (5) fish stocks. In all cases, model codes used to obtain the results of Ph.D Title are available in ./app/models and will be further explained in the corresponging sections.",

In this sense, you can select Santander Coast, North Sea, Irish Sea, Urdaibai Estuary and Cadiz Bay study areas. The affection in this Proof of Concept is based on the Physical Accounts studies and the Saltmarsh Evolution studies. Thus, it is worth noting that in some study areas you could explore the potential affection of EUNIS habitats and/or saltmarsh and mudflat current affection and under a set of climate change scenarios. The following table is a summary of the available affection in each study area:\n\n\n\nStudy Area\nPhysical Accounts\nSaltmarsh Evolution\n\n\n\n\nSantander Coast\n✅\n✅\n\n\nNorth Sea\n✅\n❌\n\n\nIrish Sea\n✅\n❌\n\n\nUrdaibai Estuary\n❌\n✅\n\n\nCadiz Bay\n❌\n✅",
