This information is crucial for informed decission-making and can promote better-designed Marine Spatial Plans (MSPs) that minimize activity impact and maximize ecosystem service delivery, including future climate change effects into habitat distributions and ecosystem service provision.\nPh.D. TITLE web application is divided into five main sections: (1) management scenarios; (2) saltmarsh evolution; (3) physical accounts; (4) EVA overscale; and (5) fish stocks. In all cases, model codes used to obtain the results of Ph.D Title are available in ./app/models and will be further explained in the corresponging sections.",
