title: "Physical Accounts"
---

The System of Environmental-Economic Accounting - Ecosystem Accounting (hereinafter SEEA-EA) is a globally adopted statistical 
standard on ecosystem accounts, which constitutes an integrated and comprehensive statistical framework for organizing data about 
ecosystems and is in use by more than 50 countries worldwide. The SEEA-EA is divided into stock and flow accounts, that can 
be either divided into physical and monetary accounts. Physical Stock Acounts are divided into ecosystem/habitat extent and condition.

In this section you can explore the Physical Stock Accounts of three study  areas investigated by 
[Egidazu-de la Parte *et al.* (2026)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qBrr96Hek-HVC-K4_4n9cyR9cEJ_d24o/edit#heading=h.i7jku579q3oc).

## How to navigate Physical Accounts?

1. Select the Study Area from the dropdown.
2. Choose the Ecosystem Components that you want to include in the habitat condition assessment (for a complete condition assessment select all).
3. Run the assessment and explore the EUNIS habitat extent and condition of the selected study area.
4. Reset the results to restart the configuration.

## How to interpret the results?

Results of the Physical Accounts reflect the EUNIS habitat **extents (km^2^)** (2023) based on [Vasquez *et al.*, 2023](Vasquez, M., Ségeat, B., Cordingley, A., Tilby, E., Wikström, S., Ehrnsten, E., Al Hamdani, Z., Agnesi, S., Andersen, M. S., Annunziatellis, A., Askew, N., Bekkby, T., Bentes, L., Daniels, E., Doncheva, V., Drakopoulou, V., Ernstsen, V. B., Gonçalves, J., Karvinen, V., Laamanen-Nicolas, L., Lillis, H., Loukaidi, V., Manca, E., McGrath, F., Mo, G., Monteiro, P., Muresan, M., Nygard, H., O'keeffe, E., Pelembe, T., Radicioli, M., Sakellariou, D., Teaca, A., Todorova, V., Tunesi, L., Woods, H.

and **condition** indicators (from very low condition - 0 to 1 - to very high condition - 4 to 5 -) based on the Ecological Value Assessment (EVA) methodology developed by [Franco *et al.*, 2026](add book chapter link) 
and adapted in the study of [Egidazu-de la Parte *et al.* (2026)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qBrr96Hek-HVC-K4_4n9cyR9cEJ_d24o/edit#heading=h.i7jku579q3oc).

Habitat condition should be interpreted as a ranking criteria of areas with better condition rather than an absolute condition 
metric indicating habitats with good or bad status. However, results of this study can be used to compare condition within a 
study area and identify hotspots with the highest condition, as well as those areas with lower condition where either policy 
or management intervention could be needed. Moreover, condition scores do not imply comparability among case studies, as 
condition scores are highly dependent on data availability and how EVA has been applied in each case study.
